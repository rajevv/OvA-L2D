We will make available the code for the above paper in this repository. In this paper, we propose an alternate One-vs-All loss function parameterization for the Learning to Defer (L2D) problem. The proposed loss function is a consistent surrogate loss function for 0-1 misclassification L2D loss with improved calibration of confidence estimates with respect to the expert correctness.
